## What does "light weight" really mean?
Light weight, developers use a lot of tools, Git, Visual Studio, and we all know what using Visual Studio is like, and plus StackOverflow for all those queries you gotta ask, you probably also use Discord, it's quite popular for developer communities and gaming too! So to toggle between co-operative workspaces and your IDE, here's Discord Lite, it uses less memory when compared to Discord Client or Google Chrome version of Discord. It also loads GIFs faster, supports Images and Videos, PDF and other documents.

## Drawbacks
There are a few drawbacks to the light weighted version ofcourse, and they are:
1. It can't be used for live streaming.
2. It can't be used for VC's
3. It can't be used for screen sharing or video calls

and that's about it.


## Inspiration and sources
This is basically a modified version of the Geeks For Geeks tutorial on how to Make a Web Browser using PyQt5, so I to decided let's modify it and make it a Discord Client since it runs Google so well.

## Known issues
None

## Roadmap
On the roadmap we've got:
1. Downloading Images using links in the Client
2. Screenshot Button to quickly screenshot chats
3. VC and Streaming support
4. Video call support
5. Switching between alts
