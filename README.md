A Light-Weight Discord Client written in **Python** for developers, by a developer.

## ‚ùì Explanation
You may have possibly heard and used Discord once in your life, right?

It can be very resource-intensive, especially with other programs running in the background.

Hence, why `Discord-Lite` was made.

It uses less memory and loads GIFs faster compared to the Client and Website version of Discord.\
It also supports sending & recieving Images, Videos, and other files.

## ‚≠ê Clarifications
This isn't any over-the-top "client" of such.\
This is simply a Discord Web Instance running in a "Custom Browser" to reduce memory usage and *not* feast on your RAM.

‚òÖ Feel free to leave a [star](https://i.imgur.com/P9YZMnF.gif) on this repo if you liked it! ‚òÖ

## üëÄ Inspiration & Sources
This is basically a modified version of the [*Geeks For Geeks*](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) tutorial on ["How to Make a Web Browser using PyQt5"](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/creating-a-simple-browser-using-pyqt5/).\
So, I decided to modify it into a Discord Client since it runs Google Instances so well.

## üëã Contributions
Any useful contribution are welcome.\
Preference will be given to those who can solve the drawback issues or implement the To-Do List features in their PR.\
Happy Coding, nonetheless! ^^

## üìÉ To-Do List
> Working Image Links through the client.\
> Live-Streaming Support.
> In some instances the VC doesnt work and opens many isntances of discord lite in the second version.\

## üí¢ Drawbacks
There are a few drawbacks to this, including:
- Streaming won't work.
- Videos load **in**consistently.(`.mov` videos load properly.)

### ...and that's about it.

## üõ†Ô∏è Known issues
Currently, Version `1.1` contains many bugs including *multiple* ***unnecessary*** tabs upon execution causing your machine to freeze.\
Also, the logo won't load which will be fixed in the next update.

```Please use an older version (1.0) for now while a hotfix is in-progress.```

## üíæ Compatibility
> Tested for Windows 10 with Python 3.9.9.\
> Issues on other systems can be openly reported.

## üìé Installation
* `pip`

```bash
pip3 install discord-lite
```

..then in your python file:

```python
import discord_lite
```

* Windows
> Install the `.exe` from this [source.](https://github.com/Sachit71/Discord-Lite/tree/main/installer)

**Note:** This is only the installer that setups the application for you.

After that, open `Discord-Lite.exe` from your desktop.\
You should be able to use Discord just as you can with any other client. :D
